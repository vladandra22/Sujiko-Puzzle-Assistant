    // Disadvantage of this is that each reasoner must be stored
    // in a variable, so that setPuzzle can be called.
    // An important question to ask is whether there is ever a need
    // to change the puzzle later.
    // If the reasoner is complex, then you may want to construct it
    // only once, and reuse it for different puzzles.
    // If you do change it later, then it would be good
    // to have the ability to set the new puzzle once for the
    // complex reasoner.
    // However, if reasoners involve cycles (which we want; possibly indirect),
    // then you have to be careful not to get into an infinite loop
    // when setting a puzzle later.
